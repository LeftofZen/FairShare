# FairShare
Generalised fair share sequence generator, aka the Thue-Morse sequence: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thue%E2%80%93Morse_sequence

Useful for fairly picking from a group of things, such as sports teams picking players in a draft.
Runs a GUI by default, command line was just for testing and can't accept input.

Note:
Can actually only go up to 9 groups because I programmed it with strings like an idiot, so it can't distinguish between the normal string 012345678910 and the rotated string (since they're the same)
